# Daily JavaScript Practice ðŸš€

This repository is where I practice JavaScript every day to build strong coding habits, improve my skills, and stay consistent.

## ðŸ“… Plan
- Code at least once every day
- Focus on one JavaScript topic or project per day
- Keep commits small but meaningful

## ðŸ›  Topics I Will Cover
- Variables and Data Types
- Functions and Loops
- Arrays and Objects
- DOM Manipulation
- Events
- Async JavaScript
- Mini Projects

## ðŸ“ˆ Why I'm Doing This
Consistency beats talent.  
By coding daily, I'm improving my problem-solving skills, learning faster, and preparing for real-world projects and interviews.
